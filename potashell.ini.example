; This is a sample configuration file for potashell
; Copy this file to potashell.ini, and modify it to suit your own needs


[CLUBLOG]
; Clublog.com registered users can put their login and password below
; for automatic uploads to Clublog at the end of each session.
;
; Uncomment these three lines, and set your own values to use this feature:
;
; clublog_email = "me@example.com"
; clublog_password = "password"
; clublog_callsign = "A12BCD"


[CUSTOM]
; To use this tool with other non-pota locations, you may add them below.
; POTA Spotting operations are disabled for custom locations, and location name lookups
; are skipped - instead your supplied location description is used.
; At the end of your session, or when you use the "push" command, logs will be uploaded
; to qrz.com and clublog if enabled, but the session log file will be prefixed CUSTOM
; instead of POTA
;
; Consider running the following command, with the example locations below uncommented:
;     potashell XX-0003 FN04IA34
;
; The ADIF file will be called "wsjtx_log_XX-0003.adi"
; MY_CITY values will be set to "YRARC Field Day site at Whitchurch-Stouffville"
;
; location[] = "XX-0001|Family Cottage at Balsam Lake"
; location[] = "XX-0002|Chalet #8 at Shalom By The Lake"
; location[] = "XX-0003|YRARC Field Day site at Whitchurch-Stouffville"


[QRZ]
; QRZ.com XML Data subscribers can put their login and password below
; for automatic lookups for any missing gridsquares seen in POTA Logfiles:
;
login = "A12BCD"
password = "S3cret"

; QRZ.com XML Data subscribers may have several logbooks, each with a callsign and API key.
; Provide your QRZ Logbook operating callsign and API Key for automatic uploads
;
apicallsign = "A12BCD"
apikey = "ABCD-1234-ABCD-1234"


[SESSION]
; Uncomment and correct the adif_directory entry to have logs for the session written
; to a single '.adi' file named like this:
;   POTA_AA-1234.adi (where AA-1234 would be the park ID)
;
; Note that if the location identifier is one of those listed in the [CUSTOM] section
; then the file name will look like this:
;   CUSTOM_XX-0003.adi
;
; adif_directory = "/Users/Username/Downloads"


[WSJTX]
; Set this to the directory where your WSJT-X datafiles are stored
; Run WSJT-X and choose 'Open log directory' from the File menu to see
; your log files folder
;
; PC USERS - your path will look like this:
; log_directory = "C:\Users\Username\AppData\Local\WSJT-X"
;
; MAC USERS = your path will look like this:
; log_directory = "/Users/Username/Library/Application Support/WSJT-X"
;
log_directory = "C:\Users\Username\AppData\Local\WSJT-X"
